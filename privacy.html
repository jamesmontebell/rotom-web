        <p><strong>MoniDex Backend.</strong> Card images and scan requests are transmitted to our backend servers at api.monidex.app for AI-powered card analysis. Our servers process card images to identify cards and retrieve pricing data from third-party sources including TCGPlayer and eBay.</p>

        <p>We may also disclose your information if required by law, legal process, government request, or when we believe disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, your safety, or the safety of others.</p>

        <h2>4. Card Image Processing</h2>

        <p>When you scan a card, the App captures a photograph using your device camera. The image is cropped to the card area and compressed before being transmitted to our servers.</p>

        <p>Card images are sent to our backend servers in base64-encoded format over a secure HTTPS connection for AI analysis.</p>

        <p>Card images are processed in real time for the purpose of identifying the card and retrieving pricing information. We do not retain card images on our servers beyond the time necessary to complete the analysis and return results, unless required for service improvement or legal compliance.</p>

        <p>You retain all ownership rights in the images you capture. By using the scanning feature, you grant us a limited license to process your images solely for the purpose of providing the Service, as described in our Terms and Conditions.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>

        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

        <p>Authentication tokens are stored securely on your device using encrypted storage provided by the operating system.</p>

        <p>All data transmitted between the App and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS/TLS protocols.</p>

        <p>While we take reasonable steps to protect your information, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security of your data.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>

        <p>We retain your account information for as long as your account remains active or as needed to provide you with the Service.</p>

        <p>Card scan images are processed in real time and are not stored on our servers beyond the time necessary to complete the scan, unless required for service improvement or legal compliance.</p>

        <p>Subscription and purchase records are retained by RevenueCat and Apple in accordance with their respective data retention policies.</p>

        <p><strong>6.4. Feedback.</strong> Feedback you submit is retained for as long as your account is active or as needed to improve the Service and respond to you. Feedback is deleted when you request account deletion, in accordance with Section 6.5.</p>

        <p><strong>6.5. Account Deletion.</strong> If you request deletion of your account, we will delete your personal data (including feedback you have submitted) from our active systems within thirty (30) days. Residual copies in backup systems will be purged within ninety (90) days. Certain data may be retained as required by law, for fraud prevention, or to resolve disputes.</p>

        <p><strong>Subscription Management.</strong> You may manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID account settings or through the App settings.</p>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not use the App or provide any personal information.</p>
