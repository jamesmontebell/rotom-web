        <h2>6. Camera and Device Permissions</h2>

        <p>You may revoke camera permissions at any time through your device settings. Revoking camera access will disable the card scanning functionality of the App.</p>

        <p><strong>User Content License.</strong> By submitting card images or any other content through the App, you grant MoniDex a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, sublicensable license to use, process, store, and analyze such content solely for the purposes of providing, improving, and developing the Service. You retain all ownership rights in your original content. This license terminates when you delete your account, except as needed for backup, archival, or legal purposes.</p>

        </ul>

        </ul>

        <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

        <p><strong>Data Retention.</strong> We retain your personal information and account data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the Service.

        <p>You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted on an individual basis and not as a class action, class arbitration, or other representative proceeding.</p>

        <h2>16. Apple App Store Terms</h2>

        <p>These Terms are between you and MoniDex only, and not with Apple Inc. ("Apple"). MoniDex, not Apple, is solely responsible for the App and its content.</p>

        <p>Apple has no obligation to provide any maintenance or support services with respect to the App.</p>

        <p>In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price (if any) for the App. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the App.</p>

        <p>Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the App, including but not limited to product liability claims, any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, and claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>

        <p>In the event of any third-party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party's intellectual property rights, Apple shall not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, or discharge of any such claim.</p>

        <p>Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms. Upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary.</p>

        <p><strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.</p>

        <p><strong>Waiver.</strong> Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

        <p><strong>Assignment.</strong> You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights under these Terms without restriction.</p>

        <p><strong>Force Majeure.</strong> We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor disputes, or failures of third-party services.</p>
